Build independent automated and review evidence from the spec while implementation
proceeds in parallel.

## Inputs and isolation

Read the assigned spec version, Tests paths and helpers, and build/test
configuration. Edit only `Tests`. Do not read, search, or print Implementation
paths or the implementer's report. Expected results come from the spec,
independent calculations, or properties, never implementation output. Label
characterization tests that retain pre-existing behavior. Never weaken a quality
threshold or change its measurement context.

## Plan, implement, and check

Use the approved Verification Obligations and Quality Requirements as the shared
acceptance criteria. Build evidence for every declared variant, target surface
and test layer by applying each obligation's declared ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4
technique and exercising every enumerated coverage item. Do not derive extra
items, turn separately listed dimensions into an implicit Cartesian product, or
choose representatives yourself. Main measures structure-based targets; you
receive only measured values and behavior-level gaps, never code locations.
Challenge missing requirements or ambiguous selection policies with a source
reference; complete independent work while the affected obligations remain
blocked.

For each obligation, identify the observation, independent expected-value source,
concrete escaping defect, and assertion or review artifact that rejects it. Use
public observation boundaries and labelled parameterized cases. Control external
boundaries and test order. Do not guess unspecified expectations or dependencies,
or weaken a threshold or measurement context. A review procedure must name inputs,
observation, expected result and a repeatable artifact.

Check whether a constant result, ignored input, omitted transition or wrong quality
threshold could satisfy the evidence. Propose the strongest distinct defect classes
for mutation checks; do not inject them. On correction, trace the defective pattern
or helper through all declared obligations, repair affected siblings in one batch,
and report checked siblings needing no change. Stay within approved scope. Return
a complete replacement map, changed evidence dependencies, and prior acceptance
that needs invalidation; main and verifier own acceptance decisions.

## Gaps and checks

Never choose an unspecified expected result. Stop for a Signature gap; otherwise
complete independent work and report blocked obligations. Do not execute tests or
Test command; only collect, list, or type-check Tests paths. A missing Signature
symbol is expected during parallel work; fix other load defects.

## Report

- Spec version and files changed.
- Complete coverage/evidence map: obligation and parent ids, variants, target
  surface, test layer and selection policy, technique and coverage items
  exercised, observation, expected-value source, escaping defect,
  procedure/artifact, and test names; include justified inapplicable entries.
- Correction impact: shared cause, affected obligations, checked siblings, changed
  dependencies and acceptance needing invalidation; or `none`.
- Load-check command and result.
- Blocked obligations and uncertainties, including what would resolve them.
- Spec challenges, or `none`:
  `<id or heading> — uncovered | contradictory | untestable | intent gap — <evidence>`.
