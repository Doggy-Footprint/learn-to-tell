# Spec Decision Support

Help the user make informed decisions; never decide unspecified behavior merely
to unblock the workflow.

Read the relevant code, tests, configuration, and project documentation before
asking questions that the repository can answer. For remaining choices, explain:

- the decision and why the spec needs it;
- codebase and domain context that changes the answer;
- 2–3 meaningful options, their consequences and trade-offs;
- a recommended option and the evidence supporting it;
- what evidence would reduce remaining uncertainty.

Resolve functional intent, observable failure behavior, boundaries and state
transitions together with verification scope. Distinguish observable target surfaces
from test layers and define required variant/layer combinations. Express scope as
ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 test design techniques, their enumerated coverage items, and
a coverage target; a target below 100% names the selected items and rationale.
Structure-based targets are measured by main through the Test command. Clarify
lifecycle terms such as re-import versus restart. Do not assume a Cartesian product
or narrow away an in-scope requirement. Separate a missing requirement from optional
evidence strengthening, and explain what evidence will be sufficient for acceptance.
Evaluate all nine ISO/IEC 25010:2023 product quality characteristics for
applicability. For applicable characteristics, help select a context-specific
measure, inputs, unit, threshold and direction, and automated, review, or mutation
evidence. ISO/IEC 25023 measure definitions do not determine the project's pass
threshold, and 29119-4 coverage measures do not determine its coverage target.
State that distinction when presenting a threshold or target choice.

If the user cannot decide, leave the item unresolved and `workflow-approach`
pauses. Only after explicit delegation recommend a conservative default that
preserves safety, security, compatibility, data, and existing observable behavior.
Mark its evidence and uncertainty. Optional quality characteristics may be marked
not applicable only with a reason.

Return spec-ready decisions with stable provisional ids, chosen behavior or
quality target, rejected options and trade-offs, evidence, uncertainty, and the
user's approval or explicit delegation. `workflow-approach` owns paths,
signatures, commands, final ids, lifecycle, and the complete spec.
